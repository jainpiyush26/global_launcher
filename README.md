# global_launcher

This is to help you configure various custom applications or 3rd party or even inbuilt applications. It gives you a clean
and easy way to manage them using the taskbar and completely platform independent. If you have the same application in
multiple OS's you can very well share the same setting file with OS specific paths for creating your own launcher.
